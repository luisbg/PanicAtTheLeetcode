# PanicAtTheLeetcode

A personal collection of LeetCode solutions as I brush up on whiteboard coding,
data structures, and algorithm patterns.

Goals:
- Stay sharp on interview-style problems
- Practice Python fluency
- Learn common patterns (stack, queue, DFS, BFS, DP, greedy, etc.)
- Keep a personal archive of solved challenges

Expect:
- Clean solutions
- Occasional refactors
- Pattern-based organization (as I improve)
- Comments where the logic matters

May contain:
- Panic
- Stacks
- Recursion
- The occasional off-by-one bug
